Repositories like GitHub may serve as vessels to enhance reproducibility in computational research. Aside from tracking the changes over time, it serves as an excellent tool for data management that is usually the basis for reproducibility. Having the raw data and cleaned-up data with steps of analysis in one file facilitates the ease of locating the specific pieces of data for other researchers. Making the repository public for others to see, criticize, use in different data sets, and, ultimately, verify the results fosters transparency in the computation field and encourages collaboration.
The translatability of the analysis across different software can be a painstaking process, especially when the software is not compatible, and you have to rewrite/analyze the new software. The same issue is found in different versions of the same software. Compatibility is not an issue with GitHub as it uses a standard system as other Git hosting services. You can even compare the data across different versions of the same software. Because of the transparency, translatability, and ease of access for other researchers â€“ all of these excellent features that are sometimes hard to achieve in bench research, enhance reproducibility.
